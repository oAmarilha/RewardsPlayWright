# Rewards Playwright 🚀

Automated multi-session browsing with Playwright to run Bing searches and collect rewards more efficiently. This repo launches two desktop browsers in parallel, completes their searches, and then launches two mobile-emulated browsers reusing the same authenticated sessions.

## ✨ Features
- **Parallel desktop runs**: Two Chromium instances run at the same time.
- **Sequenced mobile runs**: Two iPhone 13–emulated sessions start after both desktop runs finish.
- **Session reuse**: Desktop sessions store authenticated state to `storage-*.json` files, reused by mobile sessions.
- **Configurable via .env**: Control credentials and search settings without code changes.
- **Resilient sign-in flow**: Handles cookies and typical Microsoft post‑login prompts (e.g., "Yes", "Skip for now").

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `tests/rewards.spec.ts` – Main Playwright test orchestrating the desktop → mobile flow.
- `playwright.config.ts` – Playwright configuration (reporters, timeouts, etc.).
- `.env.example` – Example environment variables to copy into `.env`.
- `.gitignore` – Ensures sensitive files (like `.env`) aren’t committed.

## ✅ Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ recommended.
- Playwright browsers installed.

The project has a postinstall script to install Playwright browsers with system dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you’re on Linux and you don’t want to install system dependencies (or see errors), you can run:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

…or only the needed browser(s):

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## 🔐 Environment Setup
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials and preferences:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

`.env` keys used in `tests/rewards.spec.ts`:

- `USER1` – Email/username for account 1
- `PASS1` – Password for account 1
- `USER2` – Email/username for account 2
- `PASS2` – Password for account 2
- `DESKTOP_SEARCHES` – Number of searches per desktop session (default example: 32)
- `MOBILE_SEARCHES` – Number of searches per mobile session (default example: 22)
- `WAIT_MS` – Wait time in milliseconds between searches (default example: 10000)
- `COOLDOWN_EVERY` – After how many searches to apply a cooldown pause (default example: 4)
- `COOLDOWN_MS` – Cooldown duration in milliseconds (default example: 1830000)
- `KEYWORD_SEARCH` – Keyword to search for (default example: "cat")

> Note: `.env` is ignored by Git. Do not commit your real credentials.

## ▶️ Running the Tests
Headed (visible):

```bash
npx playwright test tests/rewards.spec.ts --headed
```

Headless (CI‑style):

```bash
npx playwright test tests/rewards.spec.ts
```

To override credentials without a `.env` file:

```bash
USER1='user1@example.com' PASS1='password1' USER2='user2@example.com' PASS2='password2' npx playwright test tests/rewards.spec.ts
```

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Loads credentials and configuration using `dotenv`.
2. Creates an API client to fetch random words from `https://api.datamuse.com/`.
3. Launches two desktop Chromium sessions in parallel.
   - Navigates to `https://bing.com/`
   - Accepts cookies if prompted
   - Signs in with `USER1` and `USER2`
   - Performs `DESKTOP_SEARCHES` random queries
   - Saves storage state to `storage-user1.json` and `storage-user2.json`
4. Launches two iPhone 13–emulated sessions in parallel.
   - Uses the saved storage states for sign‑in
   - Performs `MOBILE_SEARCHES` random queries (with optional page reloads)

## 🗂️ Storage State
- Auth states are persisted to `storage-user1.json` and `storage-user2.json` in the project root.
- These files are ignored by Git to protect your sessions.

## 🧩 Tips
- If Bing or Microsoft sign‑in flows change element IDs or text, you may need to adjust selectors in `tests/rewards.spec.ts`.
- You can tune `DESKTOP_SEARCHES`, `MOBILE_SEARCHES`, and timing values in `.env` to fit your strategy.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- "Cannot find module 'dotenv/config'":
  - Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Postinstall failure on Linux (e.g., apt key or repo errors) when running `npm install`:
  - Try installing browsers without system deps: `npx playwright install`
  - Or install only Chromium: `npx playwright install chromium`
  - Alternatively, manually install required system packages listed in Playwright docs, then rerun `npm install`.
- Sudo prompt during `--with-deps`:
  - Playwright’s `--with-deps` installs OS dependencies using your package manager. If that’s undesirable, omit `--with-deps` and ensure required libraries are installed.

## 🔒 Security
- Do not share or commit your `.env`.
- Consider using environment variables or a secure secrets manager in CI environments.
